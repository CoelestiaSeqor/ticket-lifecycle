   - Once the problem is identified and resolved, team members will update the ticket with the solution.
   - The ticket creator will be notified of the resolution and may be requested to confirm if the issue is resolved from their end.
   - If the ticket creator confirms the resolution, the ticket can be closed.
   - In case the issue persists or further action is required, the ticket can be escalated to higher-level support or relevant departments.
